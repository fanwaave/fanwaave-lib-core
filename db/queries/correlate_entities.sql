-- Owning GitHub org: fanwaave
--
-- This schema is owned by this repository. It is NOT assembled from
-- ORESoftware/k8s-libs-and-shared-defs; the org that owns the data owns the
-- DDL and the migrations that produce it. dpm is the only tool that applies
-- either, and apply requires human review.

-- Bind parameters:
--   $1  workspace_id (uuid)
--   $2  source row id (uuid)
--   $3  target entity kinds (text[])
--   $4  minimum cosine similarity (double precision)
--   $5  result count (int)
--
-- Requires search_path to include the extensions schema, or the caller must
-- schema-qualify the distance operators.

-- Correlation is the same machinery as search with the query vector read from
-- a stored row instead of computed from text, and with the source row's own
-- kind excluded so a claim correlates against evidence rather than against
-- other claims. The model_key is taken from the source row, which is what
-- keeps the comparison inside one vector space.
