-- Owning GitHub org: fanwaave
--
-- This schema is owned by this repository. It is NOT assembled from
-- ORESoftware/k8s-libs-and-shared-defs; the org that owns the data owns the
-- DDL and the migrations that produce it. dpm is the only tool that applies
-- either, and apply requires human review.

-- Bind parameters:
--   $1  workspace_id (uuid)
--   $2  newly ingested row id (uuid)
--   $3  default cosine threshold (double precision) - overridden per rule via metadata
--
-- Requires search_path to include the extensions schema, or the caller must
-- schema-qualify the distance operators.

-- An alert rule is itself a row in this table, with entity_kind = 'alert_rule'
-- and its threshold in metadata->>'threshold'. Matching a new document against
-- every rule is therefore the same nearest-neighbour question as everything
-- else here, evaluated in the direction rule <- document.
--
-- Per-rule thresholds live in metadata rather than in a column because they are
-- a property of the rule the user wrote, not of the embedding, and because a
-- rule with no explicit threshold should inherit the caller's default.
