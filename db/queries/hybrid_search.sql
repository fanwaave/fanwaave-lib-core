-- Owning GitHub org: fanwaave
--
-- This schema is owned by this repository. It is NOT assembled from
-- ORESoftware/k8s-libs-and-shared-defs; the org that owns the data owns the
-- DDL and the migrations that produce it. dpm is the only tool that applies
-- either, and apply requires human review.

-- Bind parameters:
--   $1  workspace_id (uuid)
--   $2  model_key (text) - the model the query vector came from; never mixed
--   $3  query embedding (vector(4100), unit norm, zero-padded)
--   $4  query text (text) - websearch syntax
--   $5  candidate count (int) - stage-1 fan-out, contract default 400
--   $6  result count (int) - contract default 20
--   $7  entity kinds (text[]) - null or empty means all kinds
--
-- Requires search_path to include the extensions schema, or the caller must
-- schema-qualify the distance operators.

-- Stage 1a: vector candidates. Sourced from the prefix index when the model is
-- Matryoshka, and from the bit index otherwise. Both are indexable at 4100
-- dimensions; the embedding column itself is not.
-- Stage 1b: lexical candidates from the GIN index.
-- Stage 2:  exact cosine on the union, which is the only place the full-width
--           vector is detoasted - a few hundred rows, not the table.
-- Stage 3:  reciprocal rank fusion, k=60. RRF is used because ts_rank_cd and
--           cosine distance are not on a comparable scale and normalizing them
--           against each other invents a calibration we do not have.
