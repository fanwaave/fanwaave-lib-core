//// Composed distributed locking for the ORESoftware fleet — the Gleam slice
//// of `ORESoftware/ores-locks-and-leases`.
////
//// Two layers, each individually switchable through `Layers`: an outer
//// fiducia-cloud lease (cross-host, TTL-bounded, fenced) and an inner
//// Postgres advisory lock (transaction- or session-scoped). The order is the
//// contract's and the same in every language slice:
////
////     fiducia.acquire -> pg.begin -> pg.advisory_xact_lock -> work -> pg.commit -> fiducia.release
////
//// This module is the dependency-free core: keys, the plan, errors, the
//// `Lease` seam and `with_lease` (fiducia only / neither). The adapters live
//// beside it: `ores_locks_and_leases/pg` (pog) and
//// `ores_locks_and_leases/fiducia` (gleam_httpc).
